    <a>How to Make Mac and Cheese
        You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this crowd-pleasing homemade mac and cheese:
        
        1. Boil the noodles: Boil the macaroni in salted water until the noodles are al dente. Drain and transfer to a prepared baking dish.
        2. Make the cheese sauce: Melt butter, then whisk in the flour. Whisk in the milk, bring to a simmer, and stir in the cheeses. Season with salt and pepper and continue simmering until the sauce is thick. Pour the sauce over the noodles and stir.
        3. Make the topping: Melt two tablespoons of butter in a skillet, add the bread crumbs, and toast until the crumbs are brown. Spread the topping over the macaroni and cheese, then sprinkle with paprika.
        4. Bake the mac and cheese: Bake in the preheated oven until the topping is golden brown.</a>
